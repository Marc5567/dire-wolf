### Hack and Slash
When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+Str.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.
Basic Move, pg. 58
***
### Volley
When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Dex.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you have a clear shot—deal your damage.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):
    • You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM
    • You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
    • You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one
Basic Move, pg. 60
***
### Defy Danger
When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…
    • …by powering through, +Str
    • …by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
    • …by enduring, +Con
    • …with quick thinking, +Int
    • …through mental fortitude, +Wis
    • …using charm and social grace, +Cha
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
Basic Move, pg. 62
***
### Defend
When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll+Con.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, hold 3.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, hold 1. As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
    • Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
    • Halve the attack’s effect or damage
    • Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker
    • Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level
Basic Move, pg. 64
***
### Spout Lore
When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.
Basic Move, pg. 66
***
### Discern Realities
When you closely study a situation or person, roll+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions from the list below.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, ask 1.
  Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.
    • What happened here recently?
    • What is about to happen?
    • What should I be on the lookout for?
    • What here is useful or valuable to me?
    • Who’s really in control here?
    • What here is not what it appears to be?
Basic Move, pg. 68
***
### Parley
When you have leverage on a GM Character and manipulate them, roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.
Basic Move, pg. 70
***
### Aid or Interfere
When you help or hinder someone , roll+bond with them.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, they take +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, they still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.
Basic Move, pg. 72
***
###Last Breath
When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just roll, +nothing—yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are).
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you’ve cheated Death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, Death himself will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On 6-, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.
Special Move, pg. 74
***
### Encumbrance
When you make a move while carrying weight you may be encumbered. If your weight carried is:
  • Equal to or less than your Load, you suffer no penalty
  • Less than or equal to your Load+2, you take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden
  • Greater than your Load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail
Special Move, pg. 76
***
### Take Watch
When you’re on watch and something approaches the camp roll+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a response, everyone in the camp takes +1 forward.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, you react just a moment too late; your companions in camp are awake but haven’t had time to prepare. They have weapons and armor but little else.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a miss, whatever lurks outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.
Special Move, pg. 77
***
###Undertake a Perilous Journey
When you travel through hostile territory, choose one member of the party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be quartermaster. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+:
    • the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one
    • the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much)
    • the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, each role performs their job as expected: the normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.
Special Move, pg. 77
***
### End of Session
When you reach the end of a session, choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.
Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:
  • Did we learn something new and important about the world?
  • Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
  • Did we loot a memorable treasure?
For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.
Special Move, pg. 78
***
### Level Up
When you have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills.
  • Subtract your current level+7 from your XP.
  • Increase your level by 1.
  • Choose a new advanced move from your class.
  • If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook.
  • Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.
Special Move, pg. 78
***
### Carouse
When you return triumphant and throw a big party, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every extra 100 coins spent.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, choose 3.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, choose 1.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how).
    • You befriend a useful NPC.
    • You hear rumors of an opportunity.
    • You gain useful information.
    • You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.
Special Move, pg. 79
***
### Supply
When you go to buy something with gold on hand, if it’s something readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at market price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you find what you’re looking for at a fair price.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, you’ll have to pay more or settle for something that’s not exactly what you wanted, but close. The GM will tell you what your options are.
Special Move, pg. 79
***
### Recover
When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.
Special Move, pg. 79
***
### Recruit
When you put out word that you’re looking to hire help, roll:
    • +1 if you make it known that your pay is generous
    • +1 if you make it known what you’re setting out to do
    • +1 if you make it known that they’ll get a share of whatever you find
    • +1 if you have a useful reputation around these parts
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, you’ll have to settle for someone close to what you want or turn them away.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to recruit.
Special Move, pg. 80
***
### Outstanding Warrants
When you return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before, roll+Cha.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, as above, and the GM chooses a complication:
    • The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest.
    • Someone has put a price on your head.
    • Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions.
Special Move, pg. 80
***
### Bolster
When you spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard practice, you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or more, take 1 preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, take 3 instead. When your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one preparation per roll.
Special Move, pg. 81
***
### Arcane Art
When you weave a performance into a basic spell, choose an ally and an effect:
    • Heal 1d8 damage
    • +1d4 forward to damage
    • Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
    • The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1
Then roll+Cha.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.
Bard Starting Move, pg. 84
***
### Bardic Lore
Choose an area of expertise:
  • Spells and Magicks
  • The Dead and Undead
  • Grand Histories of the Known World

  • The Planar Spheres
  • Legends of Heroes Past

When you first encounter an important creature, location, or item (your call) covered by your bardic lore you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.
Bard Starting Move, pg. 84
***
### Charming and Open

  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+ the target attacks their nearest ally in range.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9 they attack their nearest ally, but you also draw their attention and ire.
Bard Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 87
***
### Metal Hurlant
When you shout with great force or play a shattering note choose a target and roll+Con.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+ the target takes 1d10 damage and is deafened for a few minutes.

### Turn Undead
When you hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection, roll+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee.
Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from afar. They’re clever like that.
Cleric Starting Move, pg. 93
***
### Commune
When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion with your deity, you:
  • Lose any spells already granted to you.
  • Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level.
  • Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.
Cleric Starting Move, pg. 93
***
### Cast a Spell
When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9, the spell is cast, but choose one:
    • You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
    • Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.
    • After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.
Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

### Born of the Soil
You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land.
  • The Great Forests
  • The Whispering Plains
  • The Vast Desert
  • The Stinking Mire
  • The River Delta
  • The Depths of the Earth
  • The Sapphire Islands
  • The Open Sea
  • The Towering Mountains
  • The Frozen North
  • The Blasted Wasteland
Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.
Druid Starting Move, pg. 106
***
### By Nature Sustained
You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a ration just ignore it.
Druid Starting Move, pg. 107
***
### Spirit Tongue
The grunts, barks, chirps, and calls of the creatures of the wild are as language to you. You can understand any animal native to your land or akin to one whose essence you have studied.
Druid Starting Move, pg. 107
***
### Shapeshifter
When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+ hold 3.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9 hold 2. :small_orange_diamond:On a miss hold 1 in addition to whatever the GM says.
You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.
Druid Starting Move, pg. 107
***
### Studied Essence
When you spend time in contemplation of an animal spirit, you may add its species to those you can assume using shapeshifting.

### Communion of Whispers
When you spend time in a place, making note of its resident spirits and calling on the spirits of the land, roll+Wis. You will be granted a vision of significance to you, your allies, and the spirits around you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 10+ the vision will be clear and helpful to you.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a 7–9 the vision is unclear, its meaning murky.
  :small_orange_diamond:On a miss, the vision is upsetting, frightening, or traumatizing. The GM will describe it. Take -1 forward.
Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 109
***
### Barkskin
So long as your feet touch the ground you have +1 armor.
Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 109

Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 109
***
### Shed
When you take damage while shapeshifted you may choose to revert to your natural form to negate the damage.
Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 109
***
### Thing-Talker
You see the spirits in the sand, the sea and the stone. You may now apply your spirit tongue, shapeshifting and studied essence to inanimate natural objects (plants and rocks) or creatures made thereof, as well as animals. Thing-talker forms can be exact copies or can be mobile vaguely humanoid-shaped entities.
Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 109
***
### Formcrafter
When you shapeshift choose a stat: you take +1 ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted. The GM will choose a stat, too: you take -1 ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted.
Druid Level 2-5 Advanced Move, pg. 110
***
### Elemental Mastery
When you call on the primal spirits of fire, water, earth or air to perform a task for you roll+Wis.

    • You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
    • The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.
