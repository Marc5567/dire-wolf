### **n Ammo:** It counts as ammunition for appropriate ranged weapons. The number indicated does not represent individual arrows or sling stones, but represents what you have left on hand.
***
### **Forceful:** It can knock someone back a pace, maybe even off their feet.
***
### **+n Damage:** It is particularly harmful to your enemies. When you deal damage, you add n to it.
***
### **Ignores Armor:** Don’t subtract armor from the damage taken.
***
### **Messy:** It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping people and things apart.
***
### **n Piercing:** It goes right through armor. When you deal damage with n piercing, you subtract n from the enemy’s armor for that attack.
***
### **Precise:** It rewards careful strikes. You use DEX to hack and slash with this weapon, not STR.
***
### **Reload:** After you attack with it, it takes more than a moment to reset for another attack.
***
### **Stun:** When you attack with it, it does stun damage instead of normal damage.
***
### **Thrown:** Throw it at someone to hurt them. If you volley with this weapon, you can’t choose to mark off ammo on a 7–9; once you throw it, it’s gone until you can recover it.
***
### **n Armor:** It protects you from harm and absorbs damage. When you take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more than one item with n Armor, only the highest value counts.
***
### **+n Armor:** It protects you and stacks with other armor. Add its value to your total armor.
***

***
### **Reach:** It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet away—maybe as far as ten.
***

***
### **Far:** It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.
***
### **Applied:** It’s only useful when carefully applied to a person or to something they eat or drink.
***
### **Awkward:** It’s unwieldy and tough to use.
***
### **+Bonus:** It modifies your effectiveness in a specified situation. It might be “+1 forward to spout lore” or “-1 ongoing to hack and slash.”
***
