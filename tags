### n Ammo
It counts as ammunition for appropriate ranged weapons. The number indicated does not represent individual arrows or sling stones, but represents what you have left on hand.
***
### Forceful
It can knock someone back a pace, maybe even off their feet.
***
### +n Damage
It is particularly harmful to your enemies. When you deal damage, you add n to it.
***
### Ignores Armor
Don’t subtract armor from the damage taken.
***
### Messy
It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping people and things apart.
***
### n Piercing
It goes right through armor. When you deal damage with n piercing, you subtract n from the enemy’s armor for that attack.
***
### Precise
It rewards careful strikes. You use DEX to hack and slash with this weapon, not STR.
***
### Reload
After you attack with it, it takes more than a moment to reset for another attack.
***
### Stun
When you attack with it, it does stun damage instead of normal damage.
***
### Thrown
Throw it at someone to hurt them. If you volley with this weapon, you can’t choose to mark off ammo on a 7–9; once you throw it, it’s gone until you can recover it.
***
### n Armor
It protects you from harm and absorbs damage. When you take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more than one item with n Armor, only the highest value counts.
***
### +n Armor
It protects you and stacks with other armor. Add its value to your total armor.
***
### Clumsy
It’s tough to move around with. -1 ongoing while using it. This penalty is cumulative.
***
### Hand
It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no further.
***
### Close
It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a foot or two.
***
### Reach
It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet away—maybe as far as ten.
***
### Near
It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes.
***
### Far
It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.
***
### Applied
It’s only useful when carefully applied to a person or to something they eat or drink.
***
### Awkward
It’s unwieldy and tough to use.
***
### +Bonus
It modifies your effectiveness in a specified situation. It might be “+1 forward to spout lore” or “-1 ongoing to hack and slash.”
***
### Dangerous
It’s easy to get in trouble with it. If you interact with it without proper precautions the GM may freely invoke the consequences of your foolish actions.
***
### Magical
It is by nature magical through and through. 
***
### Devious
Its main danger lies beyond the simple clash of battle. 
***
### Amorphous
Its anatomy and organs are bizarre and unnatural. 
***
### Organized
It has a group structure that aids it in survival. Defeating one may cause the wrath of others. One may sound an alarm. 
***
### Intelligent
It’s smart enough that some individuals pick up other skills. The GM can adapt the monster by adding tags to reflect specific training, like a mage or warrior. 
***
